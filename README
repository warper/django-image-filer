PRE-ALPHA

Requirements:
- PIL
- mptt
- sorl.thumbnail
- django 1.1
- (south) not a requirement, but handy

for cms integration:
- django-cms-2.0

Setup
- add 'image_filer' to INSTALLED_APPS
- make the directory 'image_filer' (found in image_filer/media/') available in MEDIA_ROOT
- optional: configure IMAGE_FILER_MEDIA_URL in your project's settings.py to the URL
  where image_filer-media can be found (usually MEDIA_URL+'image_filer/' which is the
  default)


To use the example project virtualenv and pip can be used to setup a test environment:
 - mkdir example/virtualenv
 - virtualenv example/virtualenv/image_filer
 - pip -E example/virtualenv/image_filer install -r requirements.pip
 	- now you will have a virtualenv with mptt, sorl, south and django installed
 - symlink or checkout the other dependencies into the virtualenv (example/virtualenv/image_filer/lib/python2.5/site-packages/)
 - source example/virtualenv/image_filer/bin/activate
 	- now the virtualenv is active... and syncdb/runserver can be run with ./manage.py
